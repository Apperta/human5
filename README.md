## Setting Up

### GETTING STARTED
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT: INSTALL IONIC
To view the project, you need to install ionic framework and cordova. This can be done by making use of npm (Node Package Manager). 
You need to have the latest version of Node.js installed. In case you don’t, you can install it from here

1. Open a terminal window (Mac) or a command window (Windows) to install Ionic and Cordova:
npm install -g cordova ionic

On a mac, you may have to use sudo depending on your system configuration:
sudo npm install -g cordova ionic

2. If you already have Cordova and Ionic installed on your computer, make sure to update it to the latest version:
npm update -g cordova ionic
Or
sudo npm update -g cordova ionic

3. Check the version to see if it is successfully downloaded:

### WORKING WITH THE APPLICATION

1. Download the zip file, unzip it anywhere on your machine

2. Open a terminal window (Mac) or a command window (Windows), and navigate to the project directory “NHS-IBM-The-Human-Five”, and to the “TH5” folder.

3. Install the server dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the application in the browser using ionic lab
ionic serve --lab

### VIEW
After properly setting up everything, by using the ionic lab service, a development mode tab will be shown in your default browser. This simulates two general device screens for both iOS and Android.
